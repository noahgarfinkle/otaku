Statistical analysis of and modeling of US infrastructure vulnerabilities to COVID-19

## Background
This study utilizes public data about US critical infrastructure sectors in order to attempt to highlight potential challenges which may be faced in keeping the lights on and the water running during the COVID-19 pandemic.  The study is currently being completed as a course project for the Sustainable and Resilient Infrastructure Systems program at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and in no way reflects official work or policy of the United States Federal Government or the United States Department of the Army.  This unofficial nature is reflected in the name of the study, Otaku, borrowed from Max Brooks' book World War Z's discussion of computer modeling using public data.
